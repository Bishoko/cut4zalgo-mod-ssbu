## Description
This is a sound mod for **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate** (SSBU). It adds 5 songs from Ptite Soeur's album titled *"cut4zalgo"* (French music!). The songs included in this mod are:

- **(C | C) STAGE 12 - Tubular**
- **ANTHONY FANTANYL**
- **34％ 33％ 33％ + sim01, blizzard**
- **MOJIBAKE & TAMAT**
- **MAEVEMADEAMAZE**

## Installation
1. Download the mod ZIP file from the [releases](https://github.com/Bishoko/cut4zalgo-mod-ssbu/releases) section on GitHub..
2. Make sure to have [arcropolis](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/releases/latest) and [skyline](https://github.com/skyline-dev/skyline/releases/latest) installed.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file into the `sdmc:/ultimate/mods` folder.

## Features

### Version 2.x
- The songs are **added without replacing any existing tracks**.
- They are available by default in the **Pokémon Stadium** stage, as shown in this screenshot:

- A new music series called **Ptite Soeur** is added to the music series list, containing all 5 songs.

### Version 1.0
- In the initial release, the mod replaced the following songs (in order):
  - **Power-Up Music - Wrecking Crew**
  - **Wrecking Crew Retro Medley**
  - **Marionation Gear**
  - **Dillon's Rolling Western: The Last Ranger**
  - **Dawn in the Desert**

## Notes
- This mod **does not work with the HDR mod enabled** (at least it didn't work for me during testing).
- The original song names in the album contain **zalgo text**, but this has been removed in the mod to ensure the names display correctly in-game.
- This mod is intended for personal use and should not be used for commercial purposes.

## Tools Used
This mod was created using the [Sma5hMusic](https://github.com/Deinonychus71/Sma5hMusic) tool, which I highly recommend for creating custom music mods for SSBU.

## Credits
- **Ptite Soeur** - Artist of the album *cut4zalgo*.
- **Sim01** and **Blizzard** - For the track *34％ 33％ 33％ + sim01, blizzard*.
